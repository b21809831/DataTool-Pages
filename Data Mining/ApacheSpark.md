Supervised Learning: Apache Spark's MLlib library provides several algorithms for supervised learning.

Time Series Analysis: Libraries like Flint provide capabilities for time series analysis on Spark.

Text Mining: Spark's MLlib library provides feature extraction functions for text data.

Anomaly Detection: MLlib includes some methods that can be used for anomaly detection.

Association Rule Mining: Spark MLlib provides an implementation of the FP-Growth algorithm, a common algorithm used for association rule mining.

Parallel Processing: One of Spark's key features is its ability to process data in parallel across a cluster, which can greatly speed up computations.
