XGBoost, which stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is a library designed to provide a highly efficient, flexible, and portable implementation of gradient boosting algorithms. While it's not a data mining tool in the traditional sense like RapidMiner, KNIME, or Orange, it is widely used in the data science and machine learning fields, which often involve data mining tasks.

Supervised Learning: XGBoost is specifically designed for supervised learning tasks and provides several algorithms for this.
Unsupervised Learning: While not its main focus, unsupervised learning can be achieved in XGBoost with some workarounds.
Anomaly Detection: XGBoost can be used for anomaly detection tasks.
Association Rule Mining: XGBoost doesn't directly support association rule mining, but it could be used in conjunction with other tools to achieve this.
Parallel Processing: XGBoost is well-known for its efficient, scalable, and flexible implementation of gradient boosting that includes support for parallel processing.
