Human-Centric: Docker simplifies the process of managing and deploying applications in an isolated environment, thus making it easier for developers and system administrators.

Modular: Docker uses a container-based approach which allows each component of the application to be encapsulated in its own container. This makes the application modular and easier to manage.

Scalable: Docker containers can be easily created, scaled up, or torn down to meet the real-time needs of your application.
