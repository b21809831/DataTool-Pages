Amazon Kinesis 

Kinesis is a platform to stream data on AWS. It can handle real-time data streaming, which can be considered a part of the Database category (like Kafka, it's not a traditional database), but it doesn't directly provide data mining or visualization features.

Scalable: Amazon Kinesis can handle any amount of streaming data and process data from hundreds of thousands of sources.
Visual: Kinesis provides a console to monitor the real-time data stream.
