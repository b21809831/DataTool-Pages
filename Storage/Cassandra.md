Human-Centric: Cassandra is designed to handle big data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. It's human-centric in the sense that it's designed around the reality of hardware failure, and around the idea of being always available to accommodate the needs of the user.

Scalable: Cassandra is highly scalable and able to accommodate high throughput.


Distributed: Cassandra is a distributed database system. It automatically partitions data across the cluster and replicates data for fault tolerance.

Big-Data: Cassandra is designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

Key-Value: Cassandra is essentially a hybrid between a key-value and a tabular database management system. Its architecture is based on columns and column families, which can be leveraged as a key-value store.
