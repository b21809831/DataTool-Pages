Amazon S3 has some features 
Distributed: Amazon S3 is inherently distributed as it automatically distributes data across a minimum of three physical facilities that are geographically separated within an AWS Region.

Big-Data: Amazon S3 is designed to scale computing, storage, and bandwidth resources to accommodate big data and it is widely used in conjunction with big data processing tools such as Hadoop.

Stream: Amazon S3 can be used with streaming data through integrations with tools like Amazon Kinesis, which can capture, process, and store data streams.

Batch: Amazon S3 can handle batch processing workloads. It integrates with batch computing tools like AWS Batch, which allows for efficient batch processing of large volumes of data in S3.
